# CoffeeMachine
This is an educational project developed for learning and practicing core Python programming skills. The program allows users to interact with a virtual coffee machine: order drinks, manage resources (like water, milk, coffee), process payments using virtual coins, and generate reports.

## Installation guide
This project does not require any external dependencies, it runs entirely with Pythonâ€™s standard library.

1. Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.
2. Download CoffeMachine project.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.
4. Run the script: `python main.py`

## Usage guide
After running the script, you will see: 
`Type 'y' to turn ON coffee machine.`

Once turned on, the machine will ask: 
`What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino):`

At this point, you can type any of the commands listed below:

| Command                             | Description                                              |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `espresso` / `latte` / `cappuccino` | Order selected coffee type                               |
| `report`                            | Display current levels of water, milk, coffee, and money |
| `refill`                            | Refill all resources to their maximum capacity           |
| `off`                               | Turn off the machine                                     |

When you choose a coffee type:

1. The machine checks if there are enough resources.
   - If not, it notifies you which ingredients are missing and returns to the main prompt.
   - If yes, it proceeds to the **payment stage**.

2. During payment:
   - You select a **coin type** (`quarter`, `dime`, `nickel`, `penny`).
   - Then specify the **number of coins** to insert.
   - The machine checks if the inserted amount is sufficient:
     - If **not enough**, it repeats the process.
     - If **enough**, it calculates change (if any) and brews the coffee.
     - If **invalid input**, it prompts you again.
